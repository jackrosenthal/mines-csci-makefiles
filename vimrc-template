" This is a pretty lightweight .vimrc template for people getting started with
" vim. Edit it to your liking!
"
" If you are an absolute newbie to vim, I recommend you type :q now and type
" vimtutor into your terminal. You will learn how to use the basics of vim.
"
" You can put anything in here that you can type after pressing : when editing
" a file. It will run when you open vim. Put this file at ~/.vimrc
